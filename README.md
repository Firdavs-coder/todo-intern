## About the app

CodSoft Team is proud to present a user-friendly and efficient Todo App, designed and developed in Flutter. This versatile mobile application simplifies task management and enhances productivity with its array of features. Here's a detailed description of the app's functionality:

### Home Screen:

The Todo App's Home Screen is your central hub for task management. It displays a comprehensive list of your tasks, each featuring a title and a clear indicator of its completion status. This intuitive design ensures that you can easily identify and manage your tasks at a glance.

### Task Creation:

Adding new tasks has never been easier. The Todo App allows you to create tasks with just a few taps. You can provide a title for the task, and if necessary, add a detailed description to ensure clarity and context. This feature is perfect for those moments when an idea or task pops into your head and you need to quickly jot it down for later.

### Task Editing:

Flexibility is key, and the Todo App understands that your tasks might evolve. You can effortlessly edit both the title and description of your tasks whenever you need to make updates. This ensures that your task list remains current and organized, adapting to your changing needs.

### Task Completion:

As you make progress on your tasks, you can mark them as completed with a simple tap. This feature helps you keep track of your accomplishments and ensures that you stay motivated. For tasks that are not yet complete, you can mark them as active, allowing you to focus on what still needs to be done.

### Task Deletion:

When tasks are no longer relevant or necessary, you have the option to delete them from your list. This maintains the cleanliness and efficiency of your task list, so you can concentrate on what truly matters.

### Local Data Storage:

The Todo App takes data persistence seriously. It uses local data storage on your device to ensure that your tasks are always available, even when you're offline or switching devices. This way, you'll never lose track of your important to-dos, and your data is kept securely within your control.

### User Interface:

The user interface is designed with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind. It's easy to navigate, with an intuitive layout that ensures a seamless user experience. The visually appealing design and smooth interactions make managing your tasks a pleasure, not a chore.
